Self-Ordering-App
=================

Client-side implementation of university thesis project.
The app consists of two parts:
* Event module: allows the user to order tickets for certain events
* Restaurand module: supports restaurant self-ordering

These processes work with test data received from a server-side application (hosted in Google App Engine).
